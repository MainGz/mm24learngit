## Where are the branches and tags?
If you're looking for the branches and tags in this LearnGit repository, here's a friendly guide:

- **Branches**: You can see all branches by running `git branch`. In this project, we have `main` and `feature`.
- **Tags**: You can list tags by running `git tag`. We have a tag named `v0.1.0`.

Under the hood, you can find them in the `.git` directory: branches in `refs/heads/` and tags in `refs/tags/`.
